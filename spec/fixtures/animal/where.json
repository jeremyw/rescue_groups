He is aproximately 5 years old and full of love and energy.   He walks well on a leash, usually comes when he is called and so far has liked everyone he meets on sight.  He is crate trained and currently stays all night in his crate without a peep or protest.  He was rescued from the Animal Shelter by another rescue group that then turned him over to us.  He lost some weight while at the shelter and I'd like to see him gain about 5 pounds.   He is eating well here (dry kibble) so I expect he will gain the weight with no trouble.  He definately is NOT a \"kennel\" dog.  When he was confined to a kennel  (both at the shelter and at the rescue that orginally saved him) he whines and paces and won't eat well.  The rescue that pulled him from the shelter  turned him over to our rescue because our dogs are fostered in the house as our companions, not kept in kennels.  Having his best interest in mind, they needed to get him out of the kennel situation and into a home.  He does fantastic in the yard with the other dogs.  He got a bit \"ball\" posessive when the Terrier tried to take the ball he was playing with, but not a serious \"hurt you\" attack, just a \"let go\" to the young terrier.  Cardigans are the more \"laid back\" of the Corgis, BUT he is still a fairly high energy dog and needs a home where he can run and play.   I am looking for a home without small children for him.  A child 5 years or older should be just fine if they understand to be gentle.  As a breed, Corgi's don't tolerate abuse (even accidental abuse) very well.   Treated with firmness, but kindness, they are loving and very intelligent dogs.  Corgis are herd dogs, so expect a dog that loves to chase things and barks excitedly when doing so.   They usually do very well in Agility and obedience training.  Clancy was only recently neutered, so we are working on the house training.  He still has the \"male marking\" attitude so when in the house he is leashed so we can prevent him from marking.  He does appear to understand not to \"potty\" in the house, but marking his territory is a different ball game.  He is good about sitting or laying down by us when in the house and with some work, he should become reliable and understand that peeing is also NOT acceptable in the house.  At about 30 pounds and only around 12 inches high, he is a perfect dog for someone that likes big dogs, but needs a small one!  If you are interested in Clancy, please email me and tell me a bit about what you want and what you can offer a dog!  We have an adoption application we can send you if it appears that you would be a good match for him  You can see all of our fosters at our home page:  www.shortnsweetdogrescue.org  You can come visit our fosters at the open Dog Adoptathon at the North County Humane Society at 2300 Ramona Road, ATASCADERO, CA 93422 between 11:00 and 1:00 every Saturday except certain holidays. </font></p></div>","animalDescriptionPlain":"We believe Clancy is a purebred Cardigan Corgi.

There are several theories about the origins of the Welsh Corgi. Both Corgis varieties may be descended form Swedish Vallhunds brought to Wales by Vikings in the 800's. Or perhaps the Cardigan is the older variety, brought to Wales by the Celts in about 1200 BC. The name &quot;Corgi&quot; comes from the Celtic word for dog. The breed was mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086). The Corgi drove cattle by barking and nipping at the cattle's heals. His low stature helped him role out of the way when a cow kicked. Corgis still maintain that habit when chasing each other. Corgi is highly intelligent, obedient, protective and robust. Steady, loyal and loving, but wary of strangers. They are willing to please. Several of these brave dogs have lost their lives defending their homes, as they were too small for the situation. A Pembroke Welsh Corgi is well-known as the favorite breed and pet of Queen Elizabeth II.

class=\"rgDescription\">Hayes entered my life in a most unexpected way. I had gone to an ART Adoption with the intention of adopting a small poodle-mix dog I had seen online. But then I met Hayes. Hayes was an elderly gentleman. His deafness made him very visually focused and he watched people very carefully. It was apparent that Hayes had not led an easy life, which made him appreciative of every act of love and kindness. I was hooked. Hayes came to live with me and for 5 months, I was owned by Hayes. He made himself right at home on his new dog beds (yes, there were two…one upstairs and one downstairs), enjoyed good food and vitamins and most of all, he loved being the object of my affection. He followed me everywhere and was always ready to be petted and engaged in conversation. Never mind the fact that he was deaf, he enjoyed conversation. My friends kidded me about giving Hayes the “spa treatment”. He deserved no less. My sweet, barrel-shaped, short-legged boy proved to be a bird stalker/hunter and I had to keep a watchful eye on him in the park. He also thought chewing on a rawhide bone was Heaven. He made several trips with me to visit my elderly mother and he was always the perfect gentleman. On more than one occasion, I saw my mom slip him a treat and he took it gratefully and gently. In our fifth month together, Hayes’ age and hard life caught up with him in the former of cancer. I made the decision to allow Hayes to leave earth with the dignity he deserved. He was put to sleep in my arms (with an ART member by my side). He didn’t suffer. I suffered miserably. I taught Hayes what it’s like to be loved and Hayes taught me the value of living each day to the fullest, despite our disabilities. Hayes now resides at the Rainbow Bridge where I feel certain he is stalking birds and enjoying a rawhide bone now and then. And I know that he occasionally looks down on me and sends me a message of thanks, love and hope. Although I’ve adopted another “hearing challenged” dog, I think of Hayes often and smile.

Otherwise, shes very gentle with the kitties. Shes actually a little intimidated by cats that have an attitude. As for other dogs, she gets along well with dogs that are polite to her.

I'm a good boy in the house, I don't chew stuff up, only my rawhides and toys. I did have an accident on the floor,  It was only twice in a week and the only time I had an accident in the house.

I try to be a really good boy, but need someone to love and teach me all the wonderful things I should know to be a great guy. I need the excersize us little guys deserve.
